# owl
owl is a very simple language under development intended to be part of ombakwarna as macro language

Installation instructions:

1) Install python3
2) Download ombakwarna-owl folder and setup.py files
3) In the same folder that contains both ombakwarna-owl folder and setup.py, run terminal with command: python3 setup.py develop

*Windows delusional hardcore user needs to commented line 105 and de-commented line 106 in owl file before running the third instruction in command prompt. Good luck.
